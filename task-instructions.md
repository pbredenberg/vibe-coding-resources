This is a {framework} add that uses {library}. Note {doumentation files} for details of how the project is put together.

In {path/tofile} I want to accomplish X, Y, and Z (be detailed and specific about what you want and how you want it done).

Pay attention to the current version of {path/tofile}, and use a similar pattern as set by existing code.

Create a markdown file in the 'cascade' folder, and detail your plan in a todo-list format. Keep this file up to date as you work. Stop to ask me for feedback between steps.
