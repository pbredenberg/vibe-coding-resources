1. always take a declarative approach when writing code.
2. when writing typescript: always write functions with a block body over consice body.
3. important: avoid nested if statements at all costs, again, the goal is declarative, composable, clear code

IMPORTANT: eg refactoring, never remove functionality unless specifically directed to do so. refactor to retain the meaning of the code
